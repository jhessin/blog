# Why Grillbrick Studios?

I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who wonder about the name of the
website. Well that is a multi-faceted question with an answer that spans a
large time period.

## Grillbrick?

First the name Grillbrick. I was working as a cook at a restaurant in Thedford,
NE that now no longer exists. Well - it's still there but under a
different name and new manager etc. The main part of the story is that I
was listening to an audiobook. Well - it was technically an e-book that I
had run through a text-to-speech program so I could listen to it while
cleaning up. It was one of those old Forgotten Realms books with Drizzt
the dark elf. I remember being amused by how the program couldn't figure out
how to pronounce his name - it kept spelling it out.

Anyway I was cleaning the kitchen getting ready to close, scrubbing the grill
actually when I looked down at the tool I was using. It was a pumice stone that
we called a grill-brick. I go to thinking how it would be an apt name for a
dwarf, kind of tough and sturdy, and how I had always liked the dwarves'
cultures in fantasy.

In that moment I created an entire character in my mind. Grillbrick - A dwarf
that left his homeland to seek out his fortune. Not the monetary kind, but the
kind built from memories. A somewhat tragic backstory involving his brother
Warbrick and a falling out with his father. I really need to get to writing
that book...

The reason I revisited it for the name of the website is the same reason I have
always loved dwarves. I hate politics - always have and always will. I live
under the acronym KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid, or Keep It Stupid Simple, or
Keep It Simple for the Stupid, or Keep It Stupid for the Simple - you get the
idea). What Grillbrick reminds me of is that concept of cutting past the BS
(Brown Stuff) and the pettiness of politics that so many micro-cultures thrive
on.

## What kind of studio?

So that brings us back to the other part of the name - studios. A studio is
defined as a workroom for artists, musicians, etc. The key concept is that of
creation. I always wanted to create something. When I was a kid it I wanted to
write a book, or build a computer, or a starship, or something extraordinary
like that. Most recently I wanted to create video games (read my
[about](/about) section to find out how that went).

Grillbrick Studios is the combination of those two ideas - creating something
that cuts through the BS and builds something extraordinary. So now I'm
starting a blog - hoping someone out there will enjoy my ramblings. Maybe start
a web serial or two here.
