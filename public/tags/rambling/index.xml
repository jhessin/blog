      <description>Where I come from My name is Jim Hessin. I am a husband, father of three, stay at home dad, sometimes dishwasher at the rest home, and avid programmer. I have a degree in game software development, not that that means anything. I like figuring things out on the computer in my spare time.
I was born in St. Louis, MO. Moved in the third grade to South Texas. Moved around a bit but settled into the McAllen area for High School. Went to Pan-American University for a semester in Electrical Engineering then decided to join the military to help pay for school.</description>
