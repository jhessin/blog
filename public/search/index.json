[{"content":"Where I come from My name is Jim Hessin. I am a husband, father of three, stay at home dad, sometimes dishwasher at the rest home, and avid programmer. I have a degree in game software development, not that that means anything. I like figuring things out on the computer in my spare time.\nI was born in St. Louis, MO. Moved in the third grade to South Texas. Moved around a bit but settled into the McAllen area for High School. Went to Pan-American University for a semester in Electrical Engineering then decided to join the military to help pay for school. I joined the National Guard in January of 2001. I was in AIT (Advanced Individual Training) giving blood when the twin towers fell.\nAfter finishing training I transferred to UT-Austin with my second choice as major Physics. I relearned quite a bit for a semester before running out of funds again. I signed on with one of those college sales gigs selling encyclopedias door to door in Canandaigua, NY. Half way through that I had to go to annual training with the military - during which I had the epiphany that I was not cut out for sales. I found the pressure to be too much so I didn\u0026rsquo;t go back. I took some time off of school to reevaluate my life.\nI worked several different places: Radio Shack and Home Depot were the longest runs. Bounced around here and there. I settled in Charlotte, NC with my folks and started going to college again. UNC-Charlotte this time. I discovered something interesting: Colleges don\u0026rsquo;t trust each other. Nobody accepts transferred credits. I had to retake a bunch of stuff before I could get back to where I was. I tried to ease into it, but it was just a waste of time. After a deployment to Iraq I finally ended up dropping out and working at a Marble Slab Ice Cream Shop in Matthews, NC.\nThis is where my life changed forever. A girl came in asking about the music I was playing. It was my iPod loaded up with Christian music. Her sister was the one who ended up roping us together and to make a long story short we ended up getting married, and after a second tour in Iraq I left the military and we moved to her hometown in Mullen, NE.\nSo when people ask where I\u0026rsquo;m from I just tend to give them a blank stare\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2021-08-15","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/about_me/","tags":["biography","rambling","self"],"title":"About me"},{"content":"What is the point of a blog? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to start blogging now. I think the main focus of this blog is going to be me rambling about my life. Where I come from, the things that are important to me. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and be as non-confrontational as I can, but if you get offended you can always go somewhere else. I mean this is the internet\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2021-08-15","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/blogging/","tags":["blogging","rambling"],"title":"Blogging"}]
