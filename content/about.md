# Where I come from

My name is Jim Hessin. I am a husband, father of three, stay at home dad,
sometimes dishwasher at the rest home, and avid programmer. I have a degree
in game software development, not that that means anything. I like figuring
things out on the computer in my spare time.

I was born in St. Louis, MO. Moved in the third grade to South Texas. Moved
around a bit but settled into the McAllen area for High School. Went to
Pan-American University for a semester in Electrical Engineering then decided
to join the military to help pay for school. I joined the National Guard in
January of 2001. I was in AIT (Advanced Individual Training) giving blood when
the twin towers fell.

After finishing training I transferred to UT-Austin with my second choice as
major Physics. I relearned quite a bit for a semester before running out of
funds again. I signed on with one of those college sales gigs selling
encyclopedias door to door in Canandaigua, NY. Half way through that I had to
go to annual training with the military - during which I had the epiphany that
I was not cut out for sales. I found the pressure to be too much so I didn't go
back. I took some time off of school to reevaluate my life.

I worked several different places: Radio Shack and Home Depot were the longest
runs. Bounced around here and there. I settled in Charlotte, NC with my folks
and started going to college again. UNC-Charlotte this time. I discovered
something interesting: Colleges don't trust each other. Nobody accepts
transferred credits. I had to retake a bunch of stuff before I could get back
to where I was. I tried to ease into it, but it was just a waste of time. After
a deployment to Iraq I finally ended up dropping out and working at a Marble
Slab Ice Cream Shop in Matthews, NC.

This is where my life changed forever. A girl came in asking about the music I
was playing. It was my iPod loaded up with Christian music. Her sister was the
one who ended up roping us together and to make a long story short we ended up
getting married, and after a second tour in Iraq I left the military and we
moved to her hometown in Mullen, NE.

So when people ask where I'm from I just tend to give them a blank stare...

# What I'm about

My priorities are my family and Jesus. Not necessarily in that order.
Programming is a hobby, but not the main focus of my life. My oldest son has
severe autism. Some would call it "classical" autism. This is what most people
think of when they think of autism. He can't have a conversation. He can't
adjust to change. Since learning about his condition I have discovered that I
am also on the spectrum unofficially.

Up until a few months ago I was really into gaming - primarily MMOs, but
anything on a console was pretty addicting. But around may I realized it was
taking to much time out of my life. Time away from family and time away from
other productive things. I sold my PlayStation and have sworn off gaming. Maybe
one day I'll be able to pick it up again, but I don't want to be ensnared by
it.

Currently my hobbies are books, programming, and tv/movies.

## Conventions

Just to clarify here are some conventions I will use while blogging. If I talk
about reading a book I may mean sitting and reading a book, or listening to an
audiobook. I find it less confusing if I just use one term, especially for the
books that I half read and half hear. That's it for now - if there is more
clarification needed later I will update this section.
